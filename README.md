EiraIRC
=======

Minecraft Mod. On a Minecraft client it acts like any other IRC client, on the server it turns into a bridge-bot. Configuration is highly customizable and the mod includes a few special features such as name colors, Twitch chat and screenshot upload.

#API
The latest EiraIRC API and a deobfuscated version of the mod can be downloaded from my [Jenkins](http://jenkins.blay09.net) (v2.8 only). A maven repository to host the API is planned.

#Repacking Textures
EiraIRC reads its UI textures from a libGDX TextureAtlas.
The repository root contains a project file for the libGDX TexturePacker GUI. https://code.google.com/p/libgdx-texturepacker-gui/
As of now, only a TextureAtlas of size 256x256 is supported.
